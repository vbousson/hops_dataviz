Spault is also a great option for dry hopping, and brings out a wonderful hoppy flavor. Possible substitutions for German Spault hops include Saaz, Daughter Spaulter Select, or Tettnanger. Taste the distinctly German flavor of Spault hops in domestic craft brews like Ballast Point\u2019s Yellowtail Pale Ale."}, "Spaulter Select Hops": {"name": "Spaulter Select Hops", "desc": "Bred from a cross of German Spault and Hallertau Mittelfruh hops by the Hull Hop Institute , Spaulter Select hops present similar characteristics to that of both parent varietals. Used primarily as an aroma hop, Spaulter Select retains most of the floral, hoppy, and fruity aroma from Spault, but with an extra kick of spice. With an alpha acid range of 3.5% to 5.5%, Spalter Select is generally not used as a bittering hop. Spaulter Select does work in a variety of beer styles, but is naturally best suited to German Lagers, Ales, Pilsners, and Kolshes. Czech Saaz hops, Tettagner, and parent Spault offer suitable replacements for Spaulter Select if needed."}, "Sterling Hops": {"name": "Sterling Hops", "desc": "This blended varietal is half Saaz parentage with some Cascade, Brewer\u2019s Gold, and Early Green hops thrown in. The result is a unique, dual purpose hop with wonderful aromatics and smooth bittering qualities. Sterling will generally have an alpha acid content between 4.5% and 9%. The aroma presented is a combination of mild spice, citrus, and a floral bouquet that adds a nice touch to numerous beer styles. Possible substitutions for Sterling hops include Saaz and Mt. Hood. Give this unique hop a taste test in craft brews like Bombshell Blonde from Southern Star Brewery."}, "Strata Hops": {"name": "Strata Hops", "desc": "Strata, formerly called X-331, was developed by Indie Hops\u2019 in 2009.

An IPA/Session-IPA/Pale Ale (and believe it or don\u2019t, lager hop) with many layers of different fruit flavor, dried and fresh, anchored with a dried chili-cannabis-funk that does not have any diesel, machine oil, or catty \u2018baggage\u2019. Late hot side additions bring out layers of rounded-tropical plus bright-fresh fruit flavors; dry hopping yields more grapefruit and cannabis."}, "Strickelbract Hops": {"name": "Strickelbract Hops", "desc": "A product of the DSIR Research Station in New Zealand, Strickelbract hops are a cross between First Choice and open pollination and were released in 1972. Featuring both a high alpha range and robust aroma, Strickelbract is a true dual purpose brewing hop. The average alpha acid content ranges between 13% and 14.2%. This varietal works well in Bitters and ESBs. Expect a fresh piney, citrus aroma that lends itself well to other beer styles like Pales and Pilsners as well. The best substitution in lieu of Strickelbract hops would be German Northern Brewer."}, "Strisselspault Hops": {"name": "Strisselspault Hops", "desc": "One of the few varietals from France, Strisselspault hops are naturally occurring in the Stasbourg region. Strisselspault contains low and balanced levels of both alpha and beta acids in the 3% to 5% range, and is generally only used for its aromatic characteristics. The combination of spicy herbs, floral, and lemon fruit notes makes Strisselspault a perfect fit for Saisons, Maibocks, and Belgian Ales. Similar varietals Mt. Hood, Crystal, and Hersbrucker can be used in your brew in place of Strisselspault, since it is not generally easy to find."}, "Styrian Gold Hops": {"name": "Styrian Gold Hops", "desc": "Not to be confused with Styrian Golding hops, this Slovenian varietal is the product of crossing Styrian Golding with a wild native male. With an alpha acid range of about 3.5% to 6.5% and beta acids to match, Styrian Gold works well in Pilsners, ESBs, and Lagers. You can also expect an aroma of floral, herbs, and light spice, making it a good dual-purpose hop for your brew. The closest hop to substitute would be parent Styrian Golding hops."}, "Styrian Golding Hops": {"name": "Styrian Golding Hops", "desc": "A selection of Fuggles, Styrian Golding or Savinjski Golding hops, are a traditional Slovenian favorite. With a classic aroma of mild spice, floral, and herbs, Styrian Golding perfectly compliments Belgian Ales, Lagers, and even ESBs. An alpha acid range of about 1.4% to 6% lets a soft aroma be the main characteristic imparted in the brew. Since Fuggles is so closely related to Styrian Golding hops, the two are practically interchangeable in any brew recipe, though you could also substitute with Willamette. Taste Styrian Golding in English Ramsbury Brewery\u2019s Kennet Valley Pale Ale."}, "Summer Hops": {"name": "Summer Hops", "desc": "Bred from an open pollination of Czech Saaz at Tasmanian Bushy Park Breeding Garden in Australia, Summer hops were released in 1997. Known best for their fruity aroma of melon, apricot and a hint of citrus, this aroma hop imparts its unique flavor on beer styles like American Ales, IPAs, and Wheats. Summer hops will normally have an alpha acid range of about 5.6% to 6.4%. Summer hops are commonly used in the dry hopping process to really bring out those stone fruit and melon characteristics. The best way to substitute for Summer hops would likely be a combination of Belma and Palisade hops to keep that stone fruit profile. For a taste of Summer, try to pick up a Single Hop Summer IPA from Australia\u2019s Bridge Road Brewers."}, "Summit Hops": {"name": "Summit Hops", "desc": "This USDA bred hop is a cross of multiple pollinations between several hops, but most notably Zeus and Nugget. Released from the American Hops Dwarf Association in Washington in 2003, this Super Alpha varietal is ideal as a bittering addition in almost any brew. With an alpha acid range of 16% to 19%, Summit hops are most widely used for their bittering characteristics, but also contain a wonderful citrus bouquet of pink grapefruit, tangerine, and orange.

Today it is particularly hard to find, but still used globally in European style brews. With a relatively low alpha acid content of 3.1% to 5.5%, Tardif de Burgogne is primarily utilized for its mild aroma of earthy florals. These hops add a lovely touch to English and Belgian Ales, as well as some Lagers. Due to Tardif de Burgogne\u2019s soft aroma and flavor, finding a substitution is not easy, but something like Sonnet hops should be easier to track down."}, "Target Hops": {"name": "Target Hops", "desc": "Target hops are a second generation selection from Northern Brewer and Eastwell Goldings released from Wye College in 1972. With a fairly high alpha acid content and intense aroma, Target hops are a true dual purpose brewing hop. As an aromatic addition, expect an intense bouquet of sage, floral, spice and citrus that enhances English style Ales and Lagers. Target can also be used for bittering, and generally has an alpha acid range of 8% to 13%. Both British Fuggles and Willamette hops offer a reasonable substitute for UK Target pellet or whole hops.

Developed in Oregon State University\u2019s USDA laboratory, Teamaker hops are one of the strongest aroma hops out there. With an alpha acid content lower than just about any hop, from only 0.6% to 1.8%, Teamaker has no real bittering potential. What it does have is an earthy, grassy aroma with a touch of floral that comes out in full force in Pale Ale, Blonde, and Light Ale recipes. The best replacement for Teamaker hops is said to be Crystal hops."}, "Tettnanger Hops": {"name": "Tettnanger Hops", "desc": "Sometimes referred to as Tettnang, Schwetzinger, or Deutscher Fr\u00fchopfen, Tettnanger hops are a natural land race originating in the Tettnang region of Germany. A traditional noble hop, Tettnanger has been crossed with Fuggles and re-grown in a variety of regions around the world including the U.S., Australia, and Switzerland. While these Tettnanger hops go by the same name and offer the same applications in brewing, you will get a slightly different aroma and higher bittering potential due to the cross with Fuggles. With German Tettnanger hops, expect that spicy aroma with hints of floral, earthy goodness. Tettnanger has a slightly lower alpha acid range of about 3% to 6% and makes for a perfect addition to German Ales, Lagers, and Wheat Beers. Santiam hops, Spault, and Fuggles are good substitutes for Tettnanger hops if needed."}, "Tillicum Hops": {"name": "Tillicum Hops", "desc": "Developed by the Haas Breeding Program in Washington\u2019s Yakima Valley, Tillicum hops are the daughter of Galena hops and sibling to Chelan hops. Released in 1995, this proprietary hop is normally used as a bittering addition in brews due to its high alpha acid range of 13.5% to 15.5%. Hints of citrus and a sharp bitterness are the only aromatic or flavoring characteristics, and are mild at best. If you need to replace Tillicum hops in your brew recipe, the best substitutions are Chelan and Galena."}, "Topaz Hops": {"name": "Topaz Hops", "desc": "This hybrid was created by Hop Products Australia in 1985 to be primarily used as a bittering hop. At the turn of the millenium, however, craft brewers sought Topaz hops for their wonderfully unique aroma of grassy, resinous spice and a tropical note when dry-hopped. With an alpha acid range of 13.7% to 17.7%, the bittering quotient is high and smooth, making Topaz a perfect addition to all IPAs as well as Pale Ales and Dark Ales.
